# AlexNet_Neural_Network
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. It gained prominence by winning the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012 with a top-5 error rate of 15.3%, significantly outperforming the runner-up.

AlexNet consists of eight layers with learnable parameters: five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers. The architecture employs ReLU activation functions, which accelerate the training process by six times compared to tanh or sigmoid activations. The model also uses dropout layers to prevent overfitting and data augmentation to enhance generalization
